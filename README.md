# Road-Accident-Analysis

## Objectives:

Analyze monthly trends of casualties for the years 2021 and 2022.
Evaluate the impact of road types on accidents.
Visualize accident data using charts and graphs.
Present key performance indicators (KPIs) related to accidents.


## Context:
The  Accident Analysis project aims to understand and derive insights from historical accident data. The project is crucial for identifying patterns, assessing risk factors, and proposing strategies to enhance road safety.

## Accident Severity:
Accident severity is categorized into three levels:

Fatal: Incidents resulting in loss of life.
Serious: Incidents causing severe injuries.
Slight: Incidents resulting in minor injuries.

## Road Types:
Different road types can influence the likelihood and severity of accidents. 
Single carriageways, dual carriageways, roundabouts, one-way streets, and slip roads have distinct characteristics impacting traffic flow and safety.

## Weather Conditions:
Weather conditions, including dry, wet, and frost, play a pivotal role in road safety. Adverse weather can increase the likelihood of accidents, especially if drivers do not adjust their behavior accordingly.

## Vehicle Types:
Understanding the distribution of casualties across various vehicle types—cars, buses, vans, motorcycles, and others—provides insights into the vehicles most commonly involved in accidents.

## Data Description
The dataset includes comprehensive information such as accident date, location, severity, weather conditions, and vehicle types. This rich dataset enables a thorough analysis of the factors contributing to accidents.
